				   achievements as your points increase. <!--You can even compare with your
				   friends, as wedge posts to social media sites including Facebook and
				   Twitter. -->So <a href="/register">join today</a>, and become an active 
				   and helpful contributor to Wikipedia while competing with other wedge
